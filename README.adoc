The VAXstation 3100 power supplies are plagued with the usual leaky capacitor
issues.  In most cases, they are fairly easy to fix by simple cleaning the
board with isopropanol and replacing the capacitors.  One slight annoyance is
that the boards have no part designators and no polarity indication.  Hence I
took some notes.


Model H7821-00
--------------
This is the PSU in the smaller BA42-A enclosure as used for at least the
following machines:

* VAXstation 3100 M30, M38, M76
* MicroVAX/VAXserver 3100 M10, M10e, M30
* InfoServer 150
* DECstation 2100
* Storage Expansion

Here is a view of the main PCB from above, i.e., component side up:

Note that C15 and C16 are mounted to little daughter boards.  The negative
side for C15 is the one closest to the main PCB.

The original capacitor values are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description

| C1–C5      | 5        | 1800uF 25V 105C, low ESR
| C6, C11    | 2        | 330uF 25V 85C
| C7–C10     | 4        | 10uF 35V 85C
| C12        | 1        | 470uF 25V 85C
| C13, C14   | 2        | 470uF 250WV 105C
| C15        | 1        | 39uF 16V 85C
| C16        | 1        | 47uF 16V 105C
|===

I usually replace all of these by 105C capacitors of the same or higher
voltage, and use either 33uF or 47uF for C15.  Make sure to use low ESR parts
for C1–C5!

NOTE: In my experience, testing the PSU without a load works well enough.  The
fans come on and the voltages are about right.  However, the LED doesn't light
up until there is at least some load.


Model H7822-00
--------------
This is the PSU in the larger BA42-B enclosure as used for at least the
following machines:

* VAXstation 3100 M40, M48
* MicroVAX/VAXserver 3100 M20, M20e, M40, M80, M85, M88, M90, M95, M96, M98
* InfoServer 100
* DECstation 3100
* DECsystem 5100

The PSU consists of two large PCBs, one of which is identical to the one from
the smaller Model H7821-00 PSU above.  Here is a view of the second PCB, again
component side up:

image::h7822-00.svg["H7822-00 Capacitor Locations",width=80%]

The original capacitor values on this board are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Designator | Quantity | Description

| C20        | 1        | 220uF 400WV 85C
| C21        | 1        | 330uF 50V 85C
| C22        | 1        | 47uF 16V 105C
| C23–C26    | 4        | 1800uF 25V 105C, low ESR

Note that for a full PSU recap you will need these parts _and_ those listed
for the Model H7821-00.
